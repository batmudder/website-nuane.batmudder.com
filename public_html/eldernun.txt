Sister Nuane has been promoted to elder.

Abbess Abigail tells you, 'CONGRATULATION! sister. Your efforts have not been
vain and the long and hard journey you have done to get this position has
ended. The sisterhood now recognizes you as an elder nun and as a token I hand
you this fat ruler. It was used in the dawn of nuns by Sisters of Kofgaad a
long long time ago. Carry it with pride.'
