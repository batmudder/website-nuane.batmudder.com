This is the central section of the elemental complex's main hall.  Young mages
occasionally gather here to practice their spells without having to worry
about damaging their master's books.  A large dome dominates overhead and has
apparently been placed here as a way to vent any by-products from the many
dangerous spells cast in this hall.
Outside, above you is a still, clear night sky.
Obvious exits are: n, s, e and w.

This beautiful weapon looks like a flame that has taken the form of a dagger.
That might be exactly what it is, since it seems like inside the smooth
glass-like surface solid, greedy fire is dancing.
It is surrounded by a red glow.
It has a curse of channeling upon it.
This weapon is in great condition.
It looks very light weight.
