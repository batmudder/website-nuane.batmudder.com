You are done with the chant.
You praise the saints and raise tears of Oxtoth while exclaiming ' ¤Lassum¤ '
The environment blurs with intense silvery light as IMMORTAL presence of Las
fills your soul. Air thunders around you as immeasurable amount of energy is
drawn in you, lifting your body high in the air. At the peak of your might you
yell in celestial trance 'MY LIFE FOR LAS!'
You are bathed in bright light as heavenly choir plays celestial fanfare. The
universe halts as WRATH OF LAS thunders through your fuming red tears of
Oxtoth, scorching Lost spectre's face beyond recognition.
