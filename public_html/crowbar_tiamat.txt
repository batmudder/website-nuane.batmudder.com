Hot winds of HELL are blowing into your face as you walk forward
in a knee-deep sea of molten lava. You feel that your gods are on
your side, otherwise you would be a chunk of coal now. Poisonous
gas bubbles around you. The sky is reflecting the redness of the
sea of lava and the sun seems to be very close...the huge flames
from the sun almost reach to the surface of the lava sea. Remains
of some poor adventurers' blackened equipment float on the lava;
only the enchantments of the items having kept them from melting.

Snow. Ice. Snow. Ice. That is all you see as you peer around.
Freezing wind strikes against your face and almost turns your

as cold as this one; the old legends call the place by a mystical
name: Oulu... You have trouble moving forward as your legs almost
freeze to the surface of the ice field.

from the sun almost reach to the surface of the lava sea. Remains
of some poor adventurers' blackened equipment float on the lava;
